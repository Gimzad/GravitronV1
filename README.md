# GravitronV1
Fun with gravity! WASD or Arrow keys to move. Mouse to look around. Hold down left mouse button is to "climb" things. Shift is to sprint. Space to jump.
V1 is this playtest level. Future installments will include things like random level generators, modifying presets (like how big planets are, how big the gravity goes/the strength, how many planets to choose from in random generation), changing the player trail effects and colors, adding more non-gravity obstacles like blocks to hit. Also looking to include new presets like distorted gravity fields, water locations, bouncy surfaces.
For puzzle levels there will most likely remain the options to edit player settings, however for each "level" (not a sandbox) there will be recommended settings for a moderate challenge.
Simply put, this is a game about gravity! Going to develop in to a puzzle-game, and possibly a level generator, as well as editing prefab settings and spicing things up. Please make sure to check the credits in-game.
